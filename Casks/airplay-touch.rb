  caveats <<~CAVEATS
    AirPlay Touch is self-signed (not Apple-notarized).

    Quarantine is removed automatically on install. If macOS still refuses
    to open the app, allow it via System Settings → Privacy & Security →
    "Open Anyway" once.

    The companion needs Accessibility permission to forward touch events.
